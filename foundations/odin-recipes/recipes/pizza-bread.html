    <p>
      This Colorado pizza bread, with a sausage and pepperoni filling laced with
      2 kinds of cheese, is quickly made with refrigerated pizza dough. It's a
      beautiful appetizer, and hearty enough for dinner.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground Italian sausage</li>
      <li>1 cup chopped yellow onion</li>
      <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
      <li>2 (6 ounce) bags sliced pepperoni</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder, plus more for sprinkling</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 1/2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, cut into chunks</li>
      <li>2 ounces sliced black olives</li>
      <li>
        1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough, such as Pillsbury™
      </li>
      <li>1 cup shredded creamy mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Colby Jack shredded</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        In a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir Italian sausage
        until browned, about 5 minutes. Drain excess grease.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium, add onions, bell pepper, and pepperoni to the
        skillet and cook until onion and bell pepper begin to soften, about 3
        minutes. Stir in onion powder, 1 teaspoon garlic powder, salt, and
        pepper. Add cream cheese and stir constantly until well combined. Stir
        in black olives and remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Unroll pizza dough onto the
        baking sheet. Press and stretch dough into a 10x15-inch rectangle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese and 1/2 of the Colby Jack cheese
        down the middle of the pizza dough lengthwise, followed by meat mixture.
        Top meat mixture with remaining mozzarella and Colby Jack cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make 2-inch cuts into the dough from both long edges toward the meat
        mixture in the center, about 1 inch apart. Starting at the top, stretch
        each strip across in a crisscross pattern to form a loaf.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brush the loaf with melted butter. Sprinkle with garlic powder and
        grated Parmesan cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the top begins to turn golden brown, 15
        to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Cool for 10 minutes before serving. Serve with marinara sauce.</li>
    </ol>
